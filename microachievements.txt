Successful phone games have microachievements that are addictive.

To do this in SciFighters, we can use damage inflicted and kills.
These stats should be tracked in the leaderboard, and abilities
can be given based on these. Some example abilities are:
- Decreased attack cooldowns
- More powerful attacks
- Faster charging attacks
- Longer ranged attacks
- Stronger shield

These are cards that are earned by getting kills in a game, or purchased.
They are activated in the game by inflicting a certain amount of damage,
and only one can be used at a time. They are specialized per-player and
per-attack, and earned per-player - you must play as Newton to earn Newton
cards, but getting kills with the calc book will not necessarily earn
calc book cards. The exception is the shield - these apply to any player.
Each card may require a different amount of damage to activate, and a few
from your stash for the current player can be shown on the screen, greyed
out with a colored uncovering indicating when they will become available.
These can either be picked at random or chosen by the player before the
match.

After the match, based on the kills you got, you will be shown any cards
that you earned and they will be available next match.
