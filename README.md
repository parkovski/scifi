- Jump: Up. When in the air, you can use a double jump.
- Shield: Down. This will break if it gets hit too many times.  Pressing down will also let you fall through a one-way platform.
- Attack 1: c or /. Some attacks are immediate, some charge. with some projectile items, you can aim by holding a direction while you press the attack button.
- Attack 2: x or .
- Attack 3: z or ,
- Item: v or enter. When you have no item but are standing on one, this button will pick it up. If you have an item, this will use it.  Some items can be charged before they attack, to do this hold the button.
  Other items may only be thrown - in this case the button will throw them.
  To throw any item, press a direction and the item button at the same time.
